# Hangman-game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Hangman" word-guessing game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time before running out of lives.
# How to Play:
1.The game starts by displaying a logo and selecting a random word from the provided word_list.
2.The word is represented as underscores (_), each underscore representing a letter that needs to be guessed.
3.The player is prompted to input a single letter guess.
4.If the guessed letter is correct, it will replace the corresponding underscores in the word.
5.If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses one of the 6 lives.
6.The player continues guessing letters until either:
7.All letters are correctly guessed (the player wins), or
8.The player runs out of lives (the player loses).
9.The player will be notified after each guess whether theyâ€™ve won or lost a life.
